when you open the execution instructions you will see it read the token content and print it and it takes a file as a parameter but we could not directly read from file named token so in this case soft link will help 

ln -s /home/user/level08/token /tmp/file

.then

./level08 /tmp/file => quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean 

-> su flag08 password = quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean
