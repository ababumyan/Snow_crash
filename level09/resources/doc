If you try to run the execution ./level09 and test it with many letter combinations you will see
its increment avery symbols as their index like abc => a index is 0 so a + 0 b index is 1 so b + 1
after that if you open the tocken file you will see a string which is already changed by that execution so you have to decode it by reverse way decrementing the symbols by index
